## 🚀 About Me

I build production-grade systems at the intersection of blockchain and backend engineering.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on:

- Solana smart contracts (Anchor & native Rust)
- On-chain trading bots with real-time execution logic
- Staking & protocol mechanics
- Subscription-based SaaS systems
- Scalable REST APIs & backend infrastructures
- Full-stack Web3 applications

I enjoy designing systems that move value, automate logic, and scale reliably.

## 🌍 Location
Lagos, Nigeria — Open to global remote work
