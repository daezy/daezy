## 🚀 About Me

I build production-grade systems at the intersection of blockchain, AI, and backend engineering.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on:

- AI-powered applications (LLMs, agents, intelligent automation)
- Solana smart contracts (Anchor & native Rust)
- DApps across Solana and EVM ecosystems
- On-chain trading bots with real-time execution logic
- Staking & protocol mechanics
- Scalable backend infrastructures & REST APIs
- Full-stack web, mobile and blockchain applications
  
I enjoy designing systems that move value, automate logic, and scale reliably.

## 🌍 Location
Lagos, Nigeria — Open to global remote work
